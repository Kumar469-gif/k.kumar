    <h1><strong>Using Quotation and Citation tags in HTML</strong></h1>
    <br>Here is a famous quote by Albert Einstein:<br>
    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance,You must keep moving."<br>
    <br>in the context of this disscussion,one might say:<br>
    <br>"To keep your balance,You must keep moving."<br>
    <br>This quote is widely attributed to ALBERT EINSTEIN.<br>
    <br>In literary studies,it's essential to cite sources properly.For example,if you're referencing a famous Work like pride and Prejudice
        by Jane Austen,you should always include the author's name to give proper credit.<br>
    <br>Another classic example can be seen in Romeo and Jukiet
    <br>by William Shakespeare,Where love and tragedy intertwine to create a timeless story.
